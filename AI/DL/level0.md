# üå± Level 0: Deep Learning Foundation Tasks

Welcome to your first glimpse into the fascinating world of Deep Learning! These tasks are crafted for absolute beginners who have never encountered neural networks or AI before. We're not testing your existing knowledge - we're evaluating your potential to learn, understand, and think creatively about artificial intelligence.

---

## üéØ What We're Evaluating

- **Conceptual Understanding**: Can you grasp how machines might "learn" like humans?
- **Pattern Recognition**: Do you naturally spot patterns and relationships?
- **Creative Problem-Solving**: Can you think outside the box when approaching challenges?
- **Visual-Spatial Thinking**: Can you understand how information flows and transforms?
- **Curiosity & Exploration**: Do you ask "what if?" and "how does this work?"

---

## üß† The Deep Learning Mindset

Before diving in, understand that Deep Learning is about:
- Teaching computers to recognize patterns (like humans do)
- Building artificial "brains" with layers of simple decisions
- Learning from examples rather than following rigid rules
- Mimicking how our own neurons work together

**No technical background needed - just curiosity and willingness to explore!**

## üé® Task 0.1: The Human Neural Network Simulator

### **The Challenge**
Become a living neural network! Experience how deep learning works by simulating it with your friends, family, or even just pen and paper.

### **The Mission**
You're going to teach a "human neural network" to recognize handwritten numbers (0-9) using only simple yes/no decisions.

### **What You'll Do**

#### **Phase 1: Design Your Human Brain**
1. **Create the Network Structure**: Design a system with:
   - 3-5 "input friends" who look at different parts of a number image
   - 2-3 "hidden layer friends" who combine input information
   - 1 "output friend" who makes the final guess

2. **Design Simple Questions**: Each person can only ask yes/no questions like:
   - "Is there a curve in the top-right?"
   - "Are there straight lines crossing?"
   - "Is it mostly round?"

#### **Phase 2: Train Your Network**
1. Show your human network 20 handwritten numbers
2. Let each person develop their own decision rules
3. When wrong, help them adjust their questions
4. Document how the rules evolve with practice

1. Test on 10 new numbers
2. Analyze where the system struggles
3. Propose improvements to the network design
4. Compare to how you naturally recognize numbers

### **Deliverable**
