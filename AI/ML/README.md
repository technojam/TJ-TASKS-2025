- Data exploration with at least 5 interesting insights
- A classification model (any algorithm you prefer)
- Model performance evaluation with confusion matrix
- 3 actionable recommendations for the streaming platform

**Dataset**: Use the IMDB movies dataset or create a synthetic one
**Time**: 3-4 hours
**Bonus**: Create a simple web interface to input movie features and get predictions

### Task 1.2: Smart Campus Energy Optimizer ‚ö°
**Problem Statement**: Your college wants to reduce electricity bills by predicting daily energy consumption and optimizing usage.

**Scenario**: You have historical data of energy consumption, weather conditions, number of students on campus, and academic calendar events. Build a regression model to forecast tomorrow's energy needs.

**What you need to deliver**:
- Time series analysis with seasonal patterns identification
- A regression model with feature engineering
- Visualization dashboard showing predictions vs actual consumption
- Cost-saving recommendations based on your analysis

**Dataset**: Create realistic synthetic data or use available energy consumption datasets
**Time**: 3-4 hours
**Bonus**: Include weather API integration for real-time predictions

## üöÄ Level 2: Intermediate Tasks

### Task 2.1: The Social Media Sentiment Detective üïµÔ∏è
**Problem Statement**: You're building an AI system for a brand to monitor their reputation by analyzing social media posts and customer reviews.

**Scenario**: Given mixed social media data (text posts, comments, reviews), create a comprehensive sentiment analysis system that doesn't just classify positive/negative but also identifies specific emotions and topics causing sentiment.

**What you need to deliver**:
- Multi-class sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral, excited, angry, disappointed)
- Topic modeling to identify what aspects customers talk about most
- Trend analysis showing sentiment changes over time
- An automated alert system for sudden negative sentiment spikes
- Interactive dashboard with real-time sentiment monitoring

**Dataset**: Twitter sentiment data, Amazon reviews, or Reddit comments
**Time**: 6-8 hours
**Bonus**: Deploy the model as a REST API with rate limiting and authentication

### Task 2.2: Predictive Healthcare Assistant üè•
**Problem Statement**: Create an AI system that helps doctors predict patient health risks and recommend preventive measures.

**Scenario**: You have patient data including vital signs, medical history, lifestyle factors, and lab results. Build a multi-output model that predicts risk scores for different conditions (diabetes, heart disease, hypertension) and suggests personalized lifestyle interventions.

**What you need to deliver**:
- Feature engineering with medical domain knowledge
- Multi-output prediction model with uncertainty quantification
- Risk stratification system (low, medium, high risk categories)
- Personalized recommendation engine for lifestyle changes
- Model interpretability report explaining predictions

**Dataset**: Use publicly available healthcare datasets (ensure privacy compliance)
**Time**: 6-8 hours
**Bonus**: Create a chatbot interface that explains predictions in simple terms

## üî• Level 3: Advanced Tasks

### Task 3.1: Autonomous Trading Strategy Engine üìà
**Problem Statement**: Design an intelligent trading system that can adapt to market conditions and make profitable decisions while managing risk.

**Scenario**: You're tasked with creating a sophisticated trading algorithm that combines multiple ML techniques including time series forecasting, reinforcement learning, and ensemble methods. The system should handle real market data, account for transaction costs, and implement proper risk management.

**What you need to deliver**:
- Multi-timeframe analysis system (1min, 5min, 1hour, 1day)
- Ensemble model combining technical indicators, sentiment analysis, and macroeconomic factors
- Reinforcement learning agent for position sizing and timing
- Risk management system with stop-loss and portfolio optimization
- Backtesting framework with realistic market simulation
- Performance analysis with Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and other metrics
- Real-time trading simulation with paper trading integration

**Dataset**: Financial market data (stocks, forex, crypto)
**Time**: 12-15 hours
**Bonus**: Deploy as a cloud-based system with monitoring and alerting

### Task 3.2: Federated Learning Privacy Network üîê
**Problem Statement**: Build a distributed machine learning system where multiple parties can collaboratively train a model without sharing their private data.

**Scenario**: Multiple hospitals want to jointly train a medical diagnosis model but cannot share patient data due to privacy regulations. Create a federated learning system that enables collaborative training while preserving data privacy.

**What you need to deliver**:
- Federated learning architecture with client-server communication
- Privacy-preserving techniques (differential privacy, secure aggregation)
- Model aggregation strategies (FedAvg, FedProx, or custom)
- Handling non-IID data distribution across clients
- Byzantine fault tolerance for malicious clients
- Performance comparison with centralized learning
- Comprehensive privacy analysis and attack resistance evaluation

**Dataset**: Simulate multiple data silos with different distributions
**Time**: 12-15 hours
**Bonus**: Implement on blockchain for enhanced security and transparency
