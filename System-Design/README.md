## üöÄ Ready to Architect the Future?

System design is where engineering meets artistry - where you balance technical constraints with user needs, where you plan for both success and failure, and where you turn complex problems into elegant solutions.

Whether you're designing familiar systems like streaming platforms or pushing boundaries with interplanetary networks, remember:

> **"Good system design is not about using the latest technology - it's about using the right technology to solve real problems at scale."**

### Your Journey Starts Here:
1. **Choose a task** that challenges and excites you
2. **Understand the problem deeply** before jumping to solutions
3. **Think in systems** - components, interactions, and trade-offs
4. **Design for the real world** - failures happen, requirements change
5. **Communicate clearly** - great systems mean nothing if no one understands them
