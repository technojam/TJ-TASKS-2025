## üöÄ Your System Design Journey Begins

System design is fundamentally about solving human problems with technology. Whether you're managing a library or coordinating space missions, the core principles remain the same:

> **"Great systems make complex things simple for the people who use them."**

### Remember:
- **Users come first** - always design for the people who will use the system
- **Simple is better** - elegant solutions are often the simplest ones  
- **Things will break** - plan for failures and edge cases
- **Communication matters** - the best system is useless if no one understands it
- **Start small, think big** - begin with core features and expand thoughtfully

After completing Level 0, you'll have:
- A solid foundation in system thinking
- Experience breaking down complex problems
- Skills in user-centered design
- Confidence to tackle more technical challenges
- Understanding of how large systems work
