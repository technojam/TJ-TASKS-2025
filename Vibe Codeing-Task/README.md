# Vibe Codeing Audition Tasks (2025)

Welcome to the audition process! We’re here to explore how you think, create, and collaborate with the help of AI coding assistants. These tasks are designed to test your problem-solving skills, creativity, and ability to adapt to new tools. Don’t worry if you’re new—just bring your curiosity and willingness to learn. You’ll be asked to tackle logical problems, experiment with code, and showcase how you can vibe with technology to build cool solutions.

## 🎯 Task 1: Tic Tac Toe Game in One Prompt (Easy)  

### *Objective*

- ✅ Support *two players*.  
- ✅ Display game status (*win/draw*).  
- ✅ Allow *replay* after game ends.  
- ✅ *Deploy* the game on a public hosting platform.  
- ✅ Provide a .txt file containing the *exact prompt used*.  

### *Constraints*  
- 📌 *Maximum prompts*: 1 (no debugging allowed).  
- 📌 Emphasis on *prompt clarity, completeness, and correctness*.

## 💬 Task 2: Chat Application with Backend Integration (Medium)  

### *Objective*  
Build a *real-time chat application* with *frontend + backend*, deployed and fully functional.  

### *Instructions*  
- ✅ Use *vibe coding* to create frontend UI (chat messaging for multiple users).  
- ✅ Develop *backend API* for message storage and retrieval.  
- ✅ Implement *real-time capabilities* (WebSocket or polling).  
- ✅ Deploy backend and frontend (provide *public URLs* for both or a single integrated one).  
- ✅ Maintain *quality prompt usage* (no debugging prompts in creation count).  
- ✅ Prepare a .txt file documenting *all creation prompts* (excluding debugging).  

### *Constraints*  
- 📌 *Maximum prompts for creation*: 6.  
- 📌 Debugging prompts *not counted* (but must be documented separately).  
- 📌 Demonstrate familiarity with *AI agents / MCPs* (prompt design & explanation).

## 🛒 Task 3: End-to-End App Prototype (Hard)  

### *Objective*  
Iteratively build and deploy a *complete e-commerce product page app* with *cart & checkout features, including **frontend, backend, and database integration*.  

### *Instructions*  
- ✅ Break requirements into *manageable natural language prompts*.  
- ✅ Develop step by step: *UI → Backend API → Database schema → Business logic*.  
- ✅ Must include:  
  - 📦 Product listing  
  - 🛒 Cart management  
  - 💳 Checkout  
  - ✅ Confirmation page  
- ✅ Deploy the *full stack app* on a public platform.  
- ✅ Submit a .txt file capturing all *creation prompts* (excluding debugging).  
- ✅ Explain *prompt architecture* (showcasing *agentic AI / MCPs* usage).  

### *Constraints*  
- 📌 *Maximum prompts for creation*: 15.  
- 📌 Debugging prompts excluded (but must be documented separately).  
- 📌 Emphasis on *modular prompt design* + *advanced AI orchestration*.

## 📦 General Submission Requirements  

- 🔗 Provide *deployment URLs* for all tasks.  
- 📂 Include a .txt file listing *all creation prompts* for each project.  
- 📝 Provide a *brief explanation* of how *agents/MCPs* were used to optimize workflows.  
- ✅ Evaluation will focus on:  
  - *Prompt counts*  
  - *Prompt quality* (precision, clarity, effectiveness)  
  - *Functional correctness & deployment*

## 🏆 Prompt Limits Overview  

| Task | Max Prompt Count | Difficulty | Focus |
|------|------------------|------------|-------|
| 🎮 Tic Tac Toe | *1* | Easy/Medium | Single-shot prompt clarity |
| 💬 Chat App | *6* | Medium/Hard | Multi-component integration |
| 🛒 E-commerce App | *15* | Hard | Full-stack modular design |

## 🧩 How to Use These Resources in Vibe Coding  
1. **Extract Features** from tutorials (e.g., Tic Tac Toe grid, Chat UI, Cart system).  
   → Convert into **natural language prompts** for your AI.  

   Example:  
   > “Build a 3x3 Tic Tac Toe grid in HTML/CSS with styled buttons that change color when clicked.”  

2. **Iterate with Prompts** for multi-feature apps.  
   - UI prompt → API prompt → Database prompt → Integration prompt.  
   - Stay within allowed **prompt count limits** (Task 1 = 1, Task 2 = 6, Task 3 = 15).  

3. **Debug Separately** — record debugging prompts, but don’t count them against creation limits.
